# dp-search-api

Digital Publishing Search API

A Go application microservice to provide query functionality on the ONS Website

## Getting started

Set up dependencies locally as follows:

* In [dp-compose](https://github.com/ONSdigital/dp-compose) run `docker-compose up -d` to run ElasticSearch 7.10
    * dp-compose will run Elasticsearch 7.10 on port 11200 to not conflict with ES 2.2 running on port 9200
* If using the POST /search endpoint then authorisation for this requires running Vault and Zebedee as follows:
* In any directory run `vault server -dev` as Zebedee has a dependency on Vault
* In the zebedee directory run `./run.sh` to run Zebedee

Then run `make debug`

## Dependencies

* Requires ElasticSearch running on port 11200
* Requires Zebedee running on port 8082
* No further dependencies other than those defined in `go.mod`

## Configuration

## API documentation

Documentation of the API interface is described using swagger 2.0. This specification can be
found [here](./swagger.yaml).

## Go SDK - Client Package

Applications trying to interact with the API can use the Go SDK package which contains a list of client methods that are
maintained to align with
the API. For futher reading on how to use the client follow this [link](./sdk/README.md).

## Connecting to AWS Elasticsearch cluster (dev only)

### Prerequisites

* You will need an user account for the aws account you are trying to connect to
* You will need to be given a policy to allow read and write access to the AWS Elasticsearch cluster

### Connecting

To connect to managed Elasticsearch cluster in AWS, you will want to port forward 11200 to the domain endpoint. Using
the dp tool, one can do this like so:

```shell
  dp ssh develop <ip of aws box> -p 9200:<elasticsearch cluster domain endpoint e.g. "<unique identifier>" + "eu-west-1.es.amazonaws.com:443"
```

Once connected, run the following make target:

```shell
  make local
```

## Reindexing locally

Use the [dp-search-reindex-batch](https://github.com/ONSdigital/dp-search-reindex-batch) script to build a local search
index from data in your local zebedee and dataset api data.

(Note, [an earlier version of this service](https://github.com/ONSdigital/dp-search-api/tree/v1.41.0/cmd/reindex)
included a reindexing script that has now been replaced by the above tool)

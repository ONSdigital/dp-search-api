# dp-search-api

Dissemination Service Search API

A Go application microservice to provide query functionality on the ONS Website

## Getting started

Set up dependencies locally as follows:

* See our [Docker Compose Search Stack](https://github.com/ONSdigital/dp-compose/tree/main/v2/stacks/search) to run all services end to end.

Alternatively, you can just run the `dp-search-api` on it's own with `elasticsearch` v7.10 running on port 11700.

In order to surface results you will also need to populate the index in some way. Please follow the instructions in [dp-search-reindex-batch](https://github.com/ONSdigital/dp-search-reindex-batch?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started).

To run the NLP enhancement services for search you will also need to run:

* [dp-search-scrubber-api](https://github.com/ONSdigital/dp-search-scrubber-api)
* [dp-nlp-category-api](https://github.com/ONSdigital/dp-nlp-category-api)
* [dp-nlp-berlin-api](https://github.com/ONSdigital/dp-nlp-berlin-api)

For the authorisation of the POST /index endpoint you will also need to run [zebedee](https://github.com/ONSdigital/zebedee)

Then run `make debug`.

## Dependencies

* Requires ElasticSearch running on port 11200
* No further dependencies other than those defined in `go.mod`

### Validating Specification

To validate the swagger specification you can do this via:

```sh
make validate-specification
```

To run this, you will need to run Node > v20 and have [redocly CLI](https://github.com/Redocly/redocly-cli) installed:

```sh
npm install -g redocly-cli
```

## API documentation

[Documentation of the API interface](./swagger.yaml) is described using swagger 2.0.

## Go SDK - Client Package

Applications trying to interact with the API can use [the Go SDK package](./sdk/README.md) which contains a list of client methods that are
maintained to align with
the API.

## Reindexing locally

Use the [dp-search-reindex-batch](https://github.com/ONSdigital/dp-search-reindex-batch) script to build a local search
index from data in your local zebedee and dataset api data.
